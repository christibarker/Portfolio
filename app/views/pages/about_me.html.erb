		<p class="about_me">I recently went back to school in web development and have had a great experience adding to my skill set. I’m ready and looking for the right team to grow with long-term, and have abilities in multiple localities and fields that have helped me to become someone that learns my new environment and role well while also staying focused on the tasks immediately at hand. I’ve had the opportunity to live and work in major metropolitan areas of the United States and Moscow, Russia and I’ve always had a desire to achieve set goals.</p>
